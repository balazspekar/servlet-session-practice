## Basic Web App using Servlets

This is a really simple project and it's purpose is to practice and getting my feet wet with server side web development using Servlets.
Serving client side HTML directly from a Servlet is not a good pactice, however in this example it's heavily used.
The entire task purpose was to understand how does HTTPSession works.

Key Points:
- Servlets
- Tomcat cofiguration
- Eclipse EE
- Session
- HTML
- HTTP requests (POST/GET)
